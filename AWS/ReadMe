    - This guide is just my documentation with my notes and roadblock. For an in depth tutorial AWS documentation will provide with everything.
    
    [Tutorial: Configuring a static website on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)
    
    - The basis of the website is to be secure yet straightforward, and with that in mind, I choose to have an S3 Bucket that blocks all public access Off and with Static website hosting enabledâ€”then attached SSL certificate to secure it.

    - I could have my resume online with just this, but it would not be secure. To add security, I have attached an SSL certificate. I used AWS Certificate Manager, keeping in mind that the region is set to N. Virginia.
    - For validation had issues with DNS CNAME as my domain is not configurable through AWS Route53, so I opted out for email validation. Keep in mind that AWS will send the email to the following: [admin@yourdomain.com](mailto:admin@yourdomain.com), [administrator@yourdomain.com](mailto:administrator@yourdomain.com), [hostmaster@yourdomain.com](mailto:hostmaster@yourdomain.com), [postmaster@yourdomain.com](mailto:postmaster@yourdomain.com), [webmaster@yourdomain.com](mailto:webmaster@yourdomain.com).
    - After certificates are verified and approved, you create your CloudFront distribution in which you will get your URL that you will point to your DNS as a CNAME record.
    - In the end we have an S3 bucket static website distributed trough CloudFront with SSL certs attached. For a future project current visits to resume website are being logged to another S3 bucket.
